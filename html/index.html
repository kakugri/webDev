    <p class="introduction">
        I am a graduate student at the university of Florida and an incoming Software Dovelopment Engineer at Amazon Web Services. Prior to pursing graduate studies
        I worked at Schlumberger in Saudi Arabia as a Well Interventions Engineer. Over the last few years I have enjoyed building and shipping and I am excited about joining Amazon in Spring 2025 to continue building.
        You can keep track of my projects at <a href="https://github.com/kakugri" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <div class="beliefs">
        Here are afew things I believe in:
        <ul>
            <li>My faith in God is non-negotiable and I believe everyone needs to be Catholic.</li>
            <li>Creativity is infact infinite but the harnessing power needs to be honed as early as possible. This is why is it imperative that
                be allowed to express their creativy to the maximum.
            </li>
            <li>Identity politics are a zero sum game except with respect to being Catholic</li>
        </ul>
        If you happen to find my beliefs tolerable you can follow on me X (formerly Twitter) at <a href="https://x.com/kmakugri" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Twitter</a> or
